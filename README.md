# Betting Decentralised Application Using TLS-N


A decentralised application using the Ethereum network allowing users to propose and take custom bets on football matches without the need for a central counterparty. Through the use of the TLS-N protocol, our smart contracts will verify data sources and automatically execute smart contracts, transferring funds to winning parties.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Node.js
Ganache
Truffle
Web Browser with Metamask plugin


### Installing

We have provided an attached script for installing the dependencies above.

## Running the tests

To run the automated tests in our system you will need to type 'truffle test' in your command line when in the project folder.
